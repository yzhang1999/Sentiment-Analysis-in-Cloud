## Project Description
The real time system aims to classify each review as positive, neutral, or negative, providing immediate feedback to both sellers and buyers. The analysis will help sellers improve their products and services and give prospective buyers insights into product quality and customer satisfaction.

## [Dataset Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
The dataset spans reviews collected from October 1999 to October 2012, encompassing a total of 568,454 reviews. These reviews were contributed by 256,059 unique users and cover 74,258 distinct products. Among these users, 260 have provided more than 50 reviews each. This rich dataset forms the foundation for deploying a sentiment analysis model to the cloud, allowing us to analyze user sentiments across a broad range of products over an extensive time period.
